--- Original Description ---
Tired of your prey escaping into the jungles with only a bullet wound to show for it?
Wonder why your colonists complain of hunger when the ground is teeming with life?

Look no further - introducing: Insects and Bugs!

Harvest creepy crawlies for use in textiles, food, drugs, medicine, poisons...
Ants, beetles, spiders and more await!


This mod is intended to add a bit of depth to very early/tribal gameplay by offering some new drugs and much needed medicine, along with a new textile and meat food source.
So grab your blowguns and let's go!
